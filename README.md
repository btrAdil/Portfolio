# ðŸŽ® Game Development Portfolio

Welcome to my game development portfolio! Here, youâ€™ll find a collection of GIFs showcasing some of the mobile games I've developed in the hyper-casual and hybrid-casual genres. All of the games are built using Unity (C#), focusing on providing smooth, engaging gameplay experiences.

This is a work-in-progress portfolio. Currently, Iâ€™ve included an overview of a few games through GIFs, and I plan to add more games along with their source code in the future.

## Development Process

Each game in this portfolio follows a clear process. Here are the main steps:

1. **Idea & Game Design Document (GDD)**:  
   Every game starts with thinking of new ideas that work well for hyper-casual or hybrid-casual genres. Once we have the idea, we make a document called the Game Design Document (GDD).

2. **Prototype & Testing**:  
   After the idea is clear, we build a quick version of the game (called a prototype) to test how it plays. We make changes based on the feedback we get to improve the game.

3. **Development & Art**:  
   During development, I write the code to make sure the game runs smoothly. I work closely with artists to add the game's graphics, 3D objects, and animations. The goal is to ensure the game looks great and is easy to play.

4. **Testing & Feedback**:  
   We test the game carefully to find any bugs or issues. I also check how players feel when they play it. We use this feedback to improve the game before launch.

5. **Launch & Release**:  
   Once the game is ready, we prepare it for release on platforms like Google Play and the App Store. I create marketing items like icons and CPI videos to help promote the game.

### Acknowledgment

Honesty and collaboration are important to me, and Iâ€™d like to acknowledge the contribution of **Mohamed E.** who worked with me on some of the game mechanics and level design for several of these projects.
